# In-silico Identification and Functional Characterization of a Hypothetical Protein

## Step 6: Biological Interpretation (Research Outcome)

### Selected Protein
- Query protein: Hypothetical protein At1g04090  
- Organism: Arabidopsis thaliana  
- Sequence length: 572 amino acids  

---

### Homology Search Result (BLAST)
BLASTP analysis of the query protein showed a **100% identity match** with a known protein.

- Top hit UniProt ID: Q93ZR3
- Protein name: Pre-mRNA-processing factor 39-1 (PRP39-1)
- Organism: Arabidopsis thaliana
- E-value: 0.0
- Query coverage: ~100% (572/572)
- Identity: ~100%

The BLAST results show a very strong homology between the query protein and PRP39.

---

### Functional Annotation (UniProt)
According to UniProt (Q93ZR3):

- The protein is involved in **pre-mRNA splicing**
- It plays a role in **RNA processing**
- It is also involved in the **regulation of flowering time** by modulating flowering-related genes such as *FLC*, *FT*, and *SOC1*
- Protein existence: Evidence at protein level
- UniProt annotation score: 4/5

---

### Biological Interpretation
Based on the BLAST homology results and UniProt functional annotation, the hypothetical protein At1g04090 is **very likely a pre-mRNA-processing factor** involved in RNA splicing.

The strong evidence supporting this conclusion includes:
1. 100% sequence identity with a reviewed UniProt protein
2. Extremely significant E-value (0.0)
3. High query coverage across the full sequence length
4. Well-annotated biological function in UniProt

---

### Final Conclusion
The hypothetical protein At1g04090 can be confidently annotated as a **pre-mRNA-processing factor (PRP39-1)**.  
This study demonstrates how **homology-based annotation** can be used to predict the function of previously uncharacterized proteins using BLAST and UniProt databases.
